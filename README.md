This is the third freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design exercise project, my first landing page, and my first responsive design.

The landing page has a top menu that is fixed and it is different depending on the size of the screen. The content of the landing page also changes according to the screen size.

All the pictures are free. I had to include at least a youtube video to pass the freeCodeCamp's test so I used videos from "Simply Quinoa", so of course all the videos belong to her.
