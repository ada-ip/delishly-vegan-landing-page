# Delishly Vegan Landing Page 

This is the third freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design exercise project, my first landing page, and my first responsive design.

In the exercise description you're told to build a landing page of any product you want, but it needs to have a navbar that's fixed to the top, at least 3 different sections in the body with one of them being a video, a form in which the user can enter their email, and a footer. It also has to be responsive.

## :stew: Why I chose a recipe website

Since this was going to be my first responsive web design I wanted to do something simple, so I started thinking of all the web pages I usually visit, and I decided to do a recipe website landing page inspired by [Deliciously Ella's website](https://deliciouslyella.com/) but simplified. It looks really nice, I love its colors and it's split up in clear sections.

## :computer: Creating the landing page

### Navigation and header

The navigation bar has been the hardest part to implement since it had to change a lot for small screens. I used position: fixed to make it stick to the top of the page. The navbar has a logo for bigger screens but I had to change it to text for smaller screens because it was too small. I added the text in a pseudo selector but the space around it was quite different to the rest of the links of the navbar, so I decided to modify the rest of the links so they were all the same size.

The header is just some text over a background image with dimmed opacity thanks to a pseudo selector.

### Main section

The main section is divided in 3 different sections and each one of them is organized using flexbox. The hard part about learning how to use flexbox has been adjusting it to different screen sizes.

### Email form

The email form ended up being a subcribe to a newsletter type of form. The email is sent to an static page supplied by freeCodeCamp.

<br />

### Footer

Just a simple footer.

## :book: What I learned doing this project

* How to create a navbar.
* The box-sizing property.
* How to create decorative lines around a title.
* Getting comfortable with flexbox.
* Media queries. Although now I know that I should've done a mobile first design instead and I did a desktop first design.

Since I had to include at least one youtube video I had to use videos from other people. All the videos belong to the amazing [Simply Quinoa](https://www.youtube.com/user/SimplyQuinoa).
